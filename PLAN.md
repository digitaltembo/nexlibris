My ambition here is probably too grand, but broadly I would like the following qualities:
* an application for managing libraries of content, runnable on the internet, in private clouds, on phones
* in the long term supporting multiple users, encrypted data etc, doing things like managing a private library and granting library cards to other users
* in the shorter term, combining qualities of plex, jelyfin, and calibre
* and maybe mostly calibre for the shortest term, managing ebooks
* items in the library can come with fairly arbitrary metadata, although stored in a predictable format
* the metadata for a single library can hopefully be stored in a single JSON blob
* include the ability to give ratings, reviews
* include the ability to add items for which you either do or do not have the underlying media file
* include the ability to set up _devices_
* devices get a persistent set of the library, so the next time they are connected, they can be synced with any changes since last they synced
* devices can get some additional management specific to the device type
* example workflows:
  * I configure my library, and then configure the set of books which go to my xteink x4 ereader
    * books going to an xteink x4 ereaders are automatically converted into their optimized x4.epub format
    * when e.g. metadata on a book is updated, the x4.epub file is automatically updated
    * the next time I plug my ereader in, I can press a single button, and it will ensure all of the appropriate files are in the appropriate places
  * ability to scan ISBN barcodes and look up and add a book automatically (probably would need a real backend for this to encode tha ppropriate API keys)
* a TS/react frontend which can be used against a few different backends, including a pseudo-backend that stores and manages via OPFS
  * as much as possible I would like to view the media from within the frontend (e.g. epubs, mp3s, movies)
  * use https://github.com/digitaltembo/estuary-rpc to communicate with backends
* an https://github.com/digitaltembo/estuary-rpc backend, which might call out to calibre tooling, but prefer to have TS implementations of functionality where possible
* An android app which poses as a simple webview and then is effectively one of the backends, so communication is done with the android device itself instead of a server
  * the API should include syncing between different instances as well, so e.g. the android app could be synced with a website
